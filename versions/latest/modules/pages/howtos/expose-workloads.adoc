= How-to: Expose Workloads Outside the Virtual Cluster

This guide explains how to expose workloads running in k3k-managed virtual clusters to external networks. Behavior varies depending on the operating mode of the virtual cluster.

== Virtual Mode

____
[!CAUTION]
*Not Supported* +
In _virtual mode_, direct external exposure of workloads is *not available*. +
This mode is designed for strong isolation and does not expose the virtual cluster's network directly.
____

== Shared Mode

In _shared mode_, workloads can be exposed to the external network using standard Kubernetes service types or an ingress controller, depending on your requirements.

____
[!NOTE]
_`Services`_ are always synced from the virtual cluster to the host cluster following the same principle described link:../architecture.adoc#shared-mode[here] for pods.
____

=== Option 1: Use `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`

To expose a service such as a web application outside the host cluster:

* *`NodePort`*: +
Exposes the service on a static port on each node's IP. +
Access the service at `http://<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`.
* *`LoadBalancer`*: +
Provisions an external load balancer (if supported by the environment) and exposes the service via the load balancer's IP.

____
*Note* +
The `LoadBalancer` IP is currently not reflected back to the virtual cluster service. +

____

=== Option 2: Use `ClusterIP` for Internal Communication

If the workload should only be accessible to other services or pods _within_ the host cluster:

* Use the `ClusterIP` service type. +
This exposes the service on an internal IP, only reachable inside the host cluster.

=== Option 3: Use Ingress for HTTP/HTTPS Routing

For more advanced routing (e.g., hostname- or path-based routing), deploy an *Ingress controller* in the virtual cluster, and expose it via `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`.

This allows you to:

* Define Ingress resources in the virtual cluster.
* Route external traffic to services within the virtual cluster.

____
*Note* +
Support for using the host cluster's Ingress controller from a virtual cluster is being tracked in +

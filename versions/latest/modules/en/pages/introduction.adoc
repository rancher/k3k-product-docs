== {k3k-product-name}

{k3k-product-name}, a key feature of SUSE Rancher Prime, brings together the lightweight power of the open source engine link:https://github.com/rancher/k3k[K3k] and the enterprise-grade management capabilities of SUSE Virtual Cluster Management.

This solution is designed to deliver the next generation of *multi-tenancy in Kubernetes*, making it easier for platform teams to manage and for developers to innovate with self-service.
With {k3k-product-name}, you can spin up lightweight Kubernetes control planes on demand using link:https://k3s.io/[K3s], without the overhead of provisioning and managing full physical clusters.

This makes it possible to:

* Enable secure and robust multi-tenant workload isolation.
* Optimize infrastructure costs by sharing worker nodes and platform services across many virtual clusters.
* Empower developers to self-serve and experiment without impacting others.
* Give platform teams control with policy, governance, and lifecycle management tools.

{k3k-product-name} strikes the right balance between autonomy for developers and control for operators, thereby creating a scalable foundation for modern Kubernetes platforms.

== Key Components

* *SUSE Virtual Cluster Engine*: The open source project powering SUSE Virtual Cluster Engine, K3k, has passed the CNCF Kubernetes conformance tests and is listed in the link:https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/[CNCF Certified Kubernetes® Software Conformance program]. Based on K3s, a lightweight CNCF project, K3k ensures interoperability, compatibility and a consistent Kubernetes experience for workloads and tooling.

* *SUSE Virtual Cluster Management*: Manage {k3k-product-name} at scale directly from SUSE Rancher Manager with an enterprise-ready management interface. 
Features include:
- Rancher Integration - Benefit from Rancher RBAC and extend it. Create and manage virtual clusters and policies directly from Rancher. 
- CAPI Provider - Cluster API support for lifecycle automation.
- Terraform Provider (pre-release) - Infrastructure-as-Code workflows to scale and standardize cluster management.

== Why {k3k-product-name}?

With {k3k-product-name}, organizations can:

* Deliver true Kubernetes multi-tenancy with two modes, shared and virtual, fitting most production use cases (doc link - how to choose between modes). 
* Reduce cloud and infrastructure spend through shared worker pools and shared services (doc link - shared mode) from the host back to the virtual cluster. 
* Speed up developer workflows with fast, lightweight clusters in a self-service mode (doc link - quickstart UI)
* Define guardrails (doc link - virtual cluster policy) with policy, governance and lifecycle tooling, enabling seamless collaboration between platform and developers teams.

== Features and Benefits

* *Resource Isolation*: Enables workload isolation and prevents resource contention between teams or applications. K3k allows you to define resource limits and quotas for each embedded cluster, so that one team's workloads won't impact another's performance.

* *Simplified Multi-Tenancy*: Create dedicated Kubernetes environments for different users or projects, simplifying access control and management. Provide each team with its own cluster, complete with its own namespaces, RBAC, and resource quotas, without the complexity of managing multiple physical clusters.

* *Lightweight and Fast*: K3s spins up and tears down clusters quickly, accelerating development and testing cycles. Spin up a new K3k cluster in seconds, test your application in a clean environment, and tear it down just as quickly, streamlining your CI/CD pipeline.

* *Optimize Resource Utilization (Shared Mode)*: Efficiently use your infrastructure by running multiple K3s clusters on the same physical host. K3k's shared mode allows efficient sharing of resources.

* *Complete Isolation (Virtual Mode)*: K3k's virtual mode provides dedicated K3s server pods for each cluster. This ensures separation of workloads, reducing resource contention and security risks.

WARNING: Virtual Mode can allow privilege escalation and hence, you need to take caution while running in Virtual Mode.

**Certification details*: K3k conformance results are published on the link:https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/software-conformance/[CNCF listing].

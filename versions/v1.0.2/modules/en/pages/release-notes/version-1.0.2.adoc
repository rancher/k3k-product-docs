= SUSE Virtual Cluster v1.0.2 Release Highlights
:revdate: 2026-02-23
:page-revdate: {revdate}

== New Features

* Pulling images from private repositories (via `registry.yaml`) and mounting custom certificates are now fully supported allowing virtual clusters to run securely in air-gapped or restricted environments. (link:https://github.com/rancher/k3k/pull/570[#570])
* `k3kcli` now supports cluster updates, and the Rancher UI introduces context-aware sync options specifically for Shared Mode to simplify cluster configuration. (link:https://github.com/rancher/k3k/pull/595[#595], UI link:https://github.com/rancher/virtual-clusters-ui/pull/92[#92])

== Core Improvements

* Fixed the "multiplier" bug in shared mode—virtual nodes now report correct per-node resources instead of incorrectly aggregating the whole host cluster. (link:https://github.com/rancher/k3k/pull/610[#610])
* `nodeSelector` now correctly applies to agent pods, ensuring your workloads land exactly where they belong on the underlying infrastructure. (link:https://github.com/rancher/k3k/pull/616[#616])
* Refactored storage handling to attach volumes directly to PVCs and optimized server reconciliation for better performance and stability. (link:https://github.com/rancher/k3k/pull/577[#577], link:https://github.com/rancher/k3k/pull/618[#618])
* Bumped to Go 1.25 and updated Kubernetes dependencies to v1.32.10 for the latest security and performance patches. (link:https://github.com/rancher/k3k/pull/620[#620], link:https://github.com/rancher/k3k/pull/626[#626])

== Bug Fixes & Security

* Both the UI and API now correctly show enforced resource limits when a `VirtualClusterPolicy` is applied, including fixes for resource quota formatting. (link:https://github.com/rancher/k3k/pull/638[#638], UI link:https://github.com/rancher/virtual-clusters-ui/pull/97[#97])
* Refactored initialisation to wait for Node IP assignment, eliminating race conditions during cluster creation. (link:https://github.com/rancher/k3k/pull/598[#598])
* Resolved errors when reloading the virtual clusters product page and fixed policy display issues for partially assigned namespaces. (UI link:https://github.com/rancher/virtual-clusters-ui/pull/94[#94], UI link:https://github.com/rancher/virtual-clusters-ui/pull/91[#91])
